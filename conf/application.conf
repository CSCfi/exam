# Global object class
# ~~~~~
# Define the Global object class for this application.

# Router
# ~~~~~
# Define the Router object to use for this application.
# This router will be looked up first when the application is starting up,
# so make sure this is the entry point.
# Furthermore, it's assumed your route file is named properly.
# So for an application router like `conf/my.application.Router`,

# Logger

# You can also configure logback (http://logback.qos.ch/),
# by providing an application-logger.xml file in the conf directory.

# Root logger:
logger.root=ERROR

# Logger used by the framework:
logger.play=INFO

# Logger provided to your application:
logger.application=DEBUG

# deadbolt
deadbolt.java.handler=security.SitnetDeadboltHandler

# Log Ebean SQL statements

logger.com.jolbox=DEBUG

# SITNET specific configurations
#
# Sitnet application uses 3 user-roles:
# -ADMIN
# -TEACHER
# -STUDENT
#
# When user logs in the first time via Shibboleth,
# accordingly local user is created and saved in Sitnet database.
# Different universities use Shibboleth roles differently,
# that's why we need to map Shibboleth roles to Sitnet roles
#
# In the following configuration you can specify,
# which Shibboleth roles correspond to Sitnet roles
# For example: sitnet.roles.teacher="faculty,affiliate,alum"

sitnet.roles.student="student"
sitnet.roles.teacher="faculty,affiliate,alum"
sitnet.roles.admin="staff"


# Which login is in use, local development env, or HAKA
sitnet.login="DEBUG"
#sitnet.login="HAKA"

# Why use SINGLE_TABLE @Inheritance
#The main disadvantage to the joined model is that to query any class join queries are required. 
#Querying the root or branch classes is even more difficult as either multiple queries are required, 
#or outer joins or unions are required. One solution is to use single table inheritance instead, 
#this is good if the classes have a lot in common, 
#but if it is a big hierarchy and the subclasses have little in common this may not be desirable. 
#Another solution is to remove the inheritance and instead use a MappedSuperclass, 
#but this means that you can no longer query or have relationships to the class.
