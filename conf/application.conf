# EXAM specific configurations
#
# EXAM defines 3 user roles:
# -ADMIN
# -TEACHER
# -STUDENT
#
# When user logs in the first time via Shibboleth,
# accordingly local user is created and saved in EXAM database.
# Different institutions use Shibboleth roles differently,
# that's why we need to map Shibboleth roles to EXAM roles
#
# In the following configuration you can specify,
# which Shibboleth roles correspond to EXAM roles
# For example: sitnet.roles.teacher="faculty,affiliate,alum"

sitnet.roles.student="student"
sitnet.roles.teacher="faculty,affiliate,alum"
