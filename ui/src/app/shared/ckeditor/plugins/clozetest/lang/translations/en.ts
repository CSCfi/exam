    usage: `Use vertical bar ( | ) to separate correct answer options from each other. 
            Use asterisk ( * ) as a wildcard to match any series of characters. For example
            '*ship|boat|ferry' would match answers "ship", "flagship", "boat" and "ferry". 
            If you really do want to match an asterisk or a vertical pipe then use a backslash 
            like this: ( \\ )`,
